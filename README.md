# MakefileDemo
This is Makefile demo project
The reason make is very common with compiled languages is because the compilation commands for those languages can be long and complicated and difficult to remember.
 Also, you need to compile each file and link the resulting object files together. So, whenever one of the files changes, it becomes necessary to recompile it.

To use make in your project, you need to have a file named Makefile at the root of your project. This file instructs make on what to do. The Makefile consists of a set of rules. Each rule has 3 parts: a target, a list of prerequisites, and a recipe.
